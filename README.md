## DESCRIPTION: TASK-1

=> Design a basic ALU supporting operations like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, NOT....

   * An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a crucial component of a digital computer’s Central Processing Unit (CPU) or a Digital Signal Processor (DSP).
     It is responsible for performing arithmetic and logic operations on binary data.

## Functions of an ALU:

  1. Arithmetic Operations
  
     - Addition (+)
     
     - Subtraction (-)
     
     - Multiplication (*) (usually implemented separately in complex ALUs)
     
     - Division (/)
  
  2. Logical Operations
  
     - Bitwise AND (&)

     - Bitwise OR (|)

     - Bitwise XOR (^)

     - Bitwise NOT (~)
  
  3. Shift Operations
  
     - Left Shift (<<) (Shifting bits left, effectively multiplying by 2)

     - Right Shift (>>) (Shifting bits right, effectively dividing by 2)
  
  4. Rotation Operations

     - Rotate Left (Circular shift left)

     - Rotate Right (Circular shift right)

## How does an ALU work?
  
  * It receives input operands (A and B).
  
  * A control signal (ALU_Sel) determines which operation to perform.
  
  * The ALU processes the inputs based on the selected operation.
  
  * The result is sent to the output (res).
  
  * A carry flag is generated if an overflow occurs in addition.

## Importance of ALU in Computing:

  * It is the core of data processing in a CPU.
  
  * Used in microprocessors, microcontrollers, and digital signal processors.
  
  * Essential in performing computations in embedded systems, VLSI design, and general computing.
